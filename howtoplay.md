How to play!

You control the blue or green guy, your goal is to get as high of a score as possible!
You can move with the WASD keys and shoot an enemy-killing projectile with the arrow keys!
Your score goes up by itself as long as you don't touch any of the red or orange enemies that move towards you!
Every 10 seconds, your gun switches!  There are only two guns right now, one with a high firerate but only one projectile, and one with a low firerate that shoots a burst of projectiles
To signify the change between guns, the color of the background, player, and enemies will be different!
If you press the SHIFT key, you will become invincible and shoot 5x faster for a few seconds, but be warned! There is a 30-second cooldown after using it!
